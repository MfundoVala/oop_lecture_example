### An overview of the Adventure Game

The adventure game is a maze game where the user selects a player (wizard or a warrior) and moves it around on grid to find the exit. 

During the navigation process the player can encounter obstacles such as walls and traps or enemies such as orcs or goblins. 
An encounter with an enemy or obstacle will cause the player to loose
health points.

If the player runs out of health points the game is over.
The player wins if it reaches the exit with sufficient health points.

The game can be saved and continued at a later stage.
The game will prompt the user to choose whether they want to start
a new game or restore the previous game.
